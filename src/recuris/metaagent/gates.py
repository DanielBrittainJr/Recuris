"""The deterministic discipline layer: four gates, all of them code.

Nothing here consults a model, and nothing here can be talked round. A model
proposes; whether the proposal is kept is decided by arithmetic over held-out
outcomes. That asymmetry is the load-bearing part of the whole system, so it
lives in one small file that can be read end to end.

1. ``held_out_paired_gate`` -- paired significance on the held-out split. This
   is the only admission gate.
2. ``leakage_check`` -- the red line: a card may not contain test-set answers.
3. ``fingerprint_verify`` -- the prescribed mechanism must actually have fired,
   so that a change which merely captured the output format cannot claim the
   improvement it did not cause.
4. ``Ledger`` -- the do-not-repeat record.

    ``base`` and ``cand`` map an item id to the list of its per-seed scores.
    A binary benchmark gives 0/1, a dense-reward benchmark gives floats in
    [0, 1]; the estimator is continuous either way, so one implementation
    serves both.

    Per item, take the mean over seeds, then the difference ``d_i`` between the
    candidate and the base. Bootstrap over *items*, not over trials: trials
    within an item are not independent, and resampling them would report an
    interval far narrower than the evidence supports.

    ACCEPT iff the interval excludes zero on the improving side and the number
    of regressed items is at most ``reg_cap``.

    ``material`` is how large a per-item difference has to be before it counts
    as an improvement or a regression. The default 0.0 leaves the threshold at
    ``eps``, so binary callers are unaffected. Raise it for dense rewards:
    otherwise noise of the 0.97-to-0.95 kind lands in ``n_dn``, and since
    ``reg_cap`` is a hard rejection condition, counting noise there turns the
    gate into a coin flip.
